Hi! Thank you for downloading the basic version of my asset pack!

To make the character sprites easily customisable, I have cut them up into different layers. I have included instructions on how these should be layered in a file called "character_guide"! :)

If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for new assets, please let me know on the itchio page.


If you like using the assets, please consider supporting me by buying the full version if you can! It allows me to create more art and offer more free versions like this :)
